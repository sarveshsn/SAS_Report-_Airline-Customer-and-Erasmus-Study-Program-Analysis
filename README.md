# SAS Project Report: Airline Customer and Erasmus Study Program Analysis

Welcome to my SAS programming project report repository! This project involves analyzing data from two distinct studies: airline customer satisfaction and the Erasmus study program, using SAS procedures and demonstrating tasks in SAS OnDemand.

## Project Overview

### Study 1: Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis

In this section, I delve into understanding the factors influencing airline customer satisfaction. The analysis includes examining various aspects such as flight punctuality, service quality, and overall experience. Here's a glimpse of what's covered:

- **Dataset Selection**: For this study, I sourced a comprehensive dataset containing feedback from airline passengers. The dataset comprises a wide range of variables, including flight details, customer demographics, and satisfaction ratings.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Leveraging SAS procedures, I conducted extensive descriptive analysis to gain insights into customer preferences, identify trends, and uncover patterns. This involved generating graphical summaries, frequency tables, and statistical summaries to present a holistic view of the data.

### Study 2: Erasmus Study Program Analysis

In this section, I explore the dynamics of the Erasmus study program, focusing on participant demographics, study durations, and destination preferences. Here's what's included in the analysis:

- **Dataset Selection**: The dataset `erasmus.csv` serves as the foundation for this study, offering a wealth of information about individuals who participated in the Erasmus program between 2014 and 2020. This dataset encompasses diverse variables, including nationality, age, duration of study, and destination country.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Using SAS procedures, I conducted an in-depth descriptive analysis of the Erasmus dataset. From summarizing key statistics to creating visual representations, the analysis provides valuable insights into participant demographics, study durations, and academic preferences.
